<p>
<strong>Game Play</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	First and foremost, anything the Course Manager says goes. This is almost 
	always utilized to change a rule in the middle of play to give an advantage 
	to the Course Manager. The Course Manager also makes rulings on all scoring 
	disputes on the course. If the course manager is not around, then the person 
	who has had the most beers that day will settle the dispute.</li>
	<li>
	Eccles Golf can be played as individuals or with teams (scramble, best ball, 
	etc.). It is best played with no more than 4 teams (or individuals) and no 
	more than 8 people total if playing teams.</li>
	<li>
	In Eccles Golf your bag must consist of one club and one club only. It is 
	recommended that this club be a wedge of some type, but it is not required. 
	You are not permitted to change clubs at any point during a round.</li>
	<li>
	If a house is struck by a players ball then that player is immediately 
	disqualified from the round, but the team the player was on can continue a 
	person down.</li>
	<li>
	There are several out of bounds (OB) areas on the course. Anything outside 
	of the fence and any garden area cover most, if not all, OB areas. A stroke 
	penalty will be assessed for going OB and the ball must be dropped anywhere 
	that is no closer to the pin than where that player went OB.<ul>
		<li>
		One exception is on hole 6, the par 5. If a player goes OB over the far 
		fence on his/her tee shot, there is a 2 stroke penalty and that player 
		must drop from behind the garden that is in front of the green.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	Every stroke of the ball must be a single solid strike. If the ball is 
	lifted or if there is an intentional double hit, a penalty stroke will be assessed.</li>
	<li>
	To decide the starting order at the first tee box players will toss their 
	golf ball at a tee box marker chosen by the Course Manager. First up will be 
	the ball that was furthest away, second will be the second furthest ball, 
	and so on to the one that was closest. From then on out the order at the tee 
	box will be determined by the scores of the players or teams.</li>
	<li>
	When teeing up at the tee box the ball must be between the tee box markers 
	and no more than a clubs length behind them. Never place the ball in front 
	of the markers.</li>
	<li>
	Completing a hole - a hole is completed when a player makes contact with the 
	hole (the flag stick and flag count as part of the hole) with their ball and 
	the ball stays within a grips length of the outer edge of the hole OR the 
	ball comes to rest inside the hole.<ul>
		<li>
		A <strong>hole in one</strong> is awarded if on a players first shot the ball comes to 
		rest within a grips length of the outer edge of the hole (no matter if 
		the ball makes contact with the hole or not) or comes to rest inside the 
		hole (this is known as the Kevin rule). <strong>A player is awarded an extra 
		point for the hole in one.</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	Scoring - Eccles Golf is a point based golf system. Points are awarded to 
	players or teams based on the number of strokes to finish the hole, closest 
	to the pin, green in regulation, and popping it in. The points awarded are 
	as follows.<ul>
		<li>
		0 points for double bogie</li>
		<li>
		1 point for bogie</li>
		<li>
		2 points for par</li>
		<li>
		3 points for birdie</li>
		<li>
		4 points for eagle</li>
		<li>
		5 points for double eagle</li>
		<li>
		1 point for closest to (this is awarded on the same stroke that counts 
		for green in regulation and is only awarded to one player or team)<ul>
			<li>
			If a player completes a hole before the stroke that counts for green 
			in regulation, that stroke is now the stroke that is counted for 
			closest to.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		1 point for green in regulation (being on the green in par minus two 
		strokes)</li>
		<li>
		1 point for popping the ball in the hole (this point is not awarded for 
		anything more than a double bogie)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	Playoff - If two or more players or teams end with the same amount of points 
	there will be a playoff between those players or teams. The first playoff 
	hole is hole 2 and if extra holes are needed the course is continued in 
	normal order.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Course Rules</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Name calling and shit giving is encouraged.</li>
	<li>
	Drinking is allowed on the course, but please be courtious where the empties 
	are placed.</li>
	<li>
	The person in last place or the last person disqualified has to go get the 
	beers for all other players.</li>
	<li>
	Course beer is Old Style, but any beer that is brought will be allowed on 
	the course.</li>
	<li>
	Eccles Country Club has clubs, balls, and tees for rent or purchase. Balls 
	and tees are on the number 1 tee box. Clubs are located in the pro shop (the 
	garage).</li>
	<li>
	Last but not least, have a good time!</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Variants</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Scramble - A team of two or more players hit shots from the best ball of 
	their team after each stroke. The player whose ball is chosen to be played 
	must play first. Players that follow must drop their ball (from Eccles 
	shoulder height) in the same place as their teammates ball.</li>
	<li>
	Drinking Points - At the beginning of the game if all players or teams 
	agree, a point will be added to the players or teams score for every beer 
	that they finish throughout the round.</li>
	<li>
	Two Tie All Tie - If two or more players or teams tie after the round is 
	over, all players or teams participate in the playoff. On the first hole of 
	the playoff (hole 2), only the players or teams that tied have a chance to 
	win. Other players or teams may try to win the hole to keep the two players 
	or teams who tied from winning. After the first playoff hole (hole 2) all 
	teams are eligible to win the playoff.</li>
